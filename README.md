THE PROBLEM STATEMENT

So many amazing events happen on campus every single day, and compelling events can pass by without a whisper. Fixing this will create a more inclusive student experience and foster a holistic Northwestern education.

THE BIG IDEA

To make it easier for Northwestern students to discover and find interesting and relevant events happening on campus. 

REPRESENTATIVE TASKS

- NU students should be able to easily discover interesting and relevant events on campus
- NU students should be able to save events details for events theyâ€™re interested in
- On-campus organization exec members should be able to share event details/flyers with the student body
